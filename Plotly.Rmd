## Introduction

This is an exercise of plotly. The X axis is for weight in thousand ponds. The y axis is for miles per gallon. The number of cylinders are in different colors. The circle size represents different horse power.

The car weights and its fuel effenciency are in negative corelation.

## Car Weights VS MPG
```{r, warning = FALSE, message = FALSE, results = "hold", echo = FALSE}
suppressPackageStartupMessages(library(plotly))

plot_ly(mtcars, x = mtcars$wt, y = mtcars$mpg, mode = "markers", color = as.factor(mtcars$cyl), size = mtcars$hp)
```
