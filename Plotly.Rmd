```

This is an exercise of plotly. The X axis is for weights. The y axis is for miles per gallon. The number of cylinders are in different colors.  The circle size represents different horse power.

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
library(plotly)
plot_ly(mtcars, x = mtcars$wt, y = mtcars$mpg, mode = "markers", color = as.factor(mtcars$cyl), size = mtcars$hp)
```
